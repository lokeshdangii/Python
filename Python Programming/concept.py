# Problem:- If we provide only one element in a tuple than it will be not a tuple but of type of element 
# but if we provide a comma(,) after tha single element than it will be tuple 
# by running the program we can understood difference

t1 = (255)
print(t1)
print(type(t1))

t2 = (255,)
print(t2)
print(type(t2))
